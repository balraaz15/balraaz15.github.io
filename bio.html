			<h4>Personal Photo Collection</h4><hr>
			<p>I am actually not much interested in taking photos of myself or being photographed by others. However, I manage to break that rule by photographing myself with my phone or being photographed while I am visiting somewhere or it is an special occassion. The first two pictures and the last picture in this collection is taken on my birthday while I was with my friends. The third picture was taken when I had a short trek with my friends. And the fourth picture was taken while I was bored before a seminar. I may not like my photo taken at un-appropriate times but I still like to keep some photos for future.</p>

			<h4>Group Photo Collection</h4><hr>
			<p>I am gifted with many friends in my life. And I feel happy that they all good guys and helful people. When I first joined school, I did not have a single friend. But gradually the circle became wider and wider, we made so many memories throughout and stayed in touch. We used to plaly football and futsal and won many games. The 1st and 4th picture is of my team. The 5th picture was taken in school just after the capmfire where we all looked happy and energetic. Other pictures include some occassional gatherings be it for visits of recreational activities.</p>

			<h4>Photographed Photo Collection</h4><hr>
			<p>Although I don't fancy taking my own photos but I love to take photos. Whenever I go to some place nice, I take photographs of those places and other fascinating things. I don't have fancy and expensive cameras and lenses but I take most of the photos with from my smartphone. My phone never disappoints me. As much as I love to take photographs, I also love editing the photographs to give the photos special effects. Although I am not quite good at editing, I try whatsoever and it makes me happy. Most of my photograps include the pictures of historical and cultural heritages. I also like to capture the nature and other interesting things I see on some occassions and special days. I also use Instagram a lot, post my pictures there and also see other amazing galleries of talented photographers and I try to learn from them.</p>
